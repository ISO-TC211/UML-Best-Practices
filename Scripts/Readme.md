## Scripts
Scripts for working with UML models for geographic information in UML. The scripts are written either in
* [JScript](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/UML-Best-Practices/tree/master/Scripts/JScript) or in
* [VBScript](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/UML-Best-Practices/tree/master/Scripts/VBScript)

The scripts are organised in different categories:
* CHG: scripts that change the model
* DOC scripts that produce documentation of the model
* INFO scripts that show information about the eap-file or related stuff
* VAL scripts that validate models
* scripts that start with an underscore should not/cannot be run directly
